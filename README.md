# Dask Playground

A comprehensive hands-on repository for mastering Dask - the parallel and distributed computing library for Python.

## 🚀 About This Repository

This repository belongs to my "*-playground" series, focused on mastering tools and technologies that enable the creation of scalable systems. Dask is a flexible parallel computing library for Python that makes it easy to scale your data science and machine learning workflows.

## 📋 What is Dask?

Dask provides advanced parallelism for analytics, enabling performance at scale for the tools you love. It's composed of:

- **Dask Arrays**: Parallel NumPy arrays
- **Dask DataFrames**: Parallel Pandas DataFrames
- **Dask Bags**: Parallel Python lists
- **Dask Delayed**: Parallel function execution
- **Dask Distributed**: A distributed task scheduler for Dask
